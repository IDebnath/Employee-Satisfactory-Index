# Employee-Satisfactory-Index

A data analysis project from a course: CS2610 at Western Michigan University. Initially we were tasked to choose any dataset from the web to work on and find a solution to a real life problem. I chose "Employee Satifaction Index" dataset from www.kaggle.com 
In this report I answered the following questions after analyzing the dataset using R.
1. Are employees satisfied with their salary based on their job level? 
2. Does a high salary job require a high level of educational degree? 
3. Are employees with awards satisfied more with their job?
4. Which departments have the highest salaries? 
5. How does job level influence job satisfaction? 
6. Does job level influence salary? 
7. What is the average salary in each dept.?
